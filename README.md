# UNO Flip

A version of the popular card game, UNO. The game is currently in early stages of development, with a focus on the backend gameplay before moving on to the GUI and website development. The website will be built using Django.

The goal of this project is to create a fully functional online version of UNO Flip that allows players to join games and play against each other in real-time. The backend of the game will be written in Python.

The project will include features such as:

- A lobby system where players can join and create games
- A chat system for players to communicate during gameplay
- In-game actions such as drawing cards, playing cards, and flipping the deck
- A scoring system to keep track of players' points

## How to Install and Run the Project

The project is currently in early development, so there is no way to run the game yet. However, once the project is complete, instructions on how to install and run the game will be provided here.
